# Jungle Devs - React Challenge #002

The main objetive of this activity is to consolidate what you've just learned about React â€“ especially component usage and state handling. You'll be implementing a simplified version of [Hapu](https://www.hapu.com.au)'s '[Become a Nanny Share Host](https://www.hapu.com.au/become-nanny-share-host)' page.

After you finish it you'll continue working with these project to learn responsive web design, by implementing the mobile version of this same Hapu's page.

The design will be available at [Zeplin](https://app.zeplin.io/project/5ae76eec5b07c280209f6450/dashboard?seid=5b05a6a9b1ca0681a092f987) app and any resource needed is available at the [assets folder](/src/assets).
